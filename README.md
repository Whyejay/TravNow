# TravNow
The website I would like to implement is called TravNow. The main idea of the website is for travelers to share their traveling experiences. 
Users will be able to choose their country of destination and view what other registered user had posted.
Users who would love to share their experiences will be able to create an account. They will be able to login and upload images and details of the experiences and places they had been to, such as tourist attraction, cafes, restaurants and ‘hidden places’ that not many people know of. Not only that, they would provide details on how and when to get to those places to seal the best deal that the nature or the country offers.
This will let other users know where they can find the places and also to share their experiences there.
Overall, this website will be implemented through the concept of a blog.
