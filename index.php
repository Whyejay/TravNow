<!--            by Premier Jack Lang, after six years of construction. Made of steel the bridge contains 6 million hand-->
<!--            driven rivets. The surface area that requires painting is equal to about the surface area of 60 sports-->
<!--            fields. The Bridge has huge hinges to absorb the expansion caused by the hot Sydney sun. You will see them-->
<!--            on either side of the bridge at the footings of the Pylons.-->
<!---->
<!--            The views and photo opportunities are fantastic. (If you can make it, we've got to say it is tough). There-->
<!--            is a great display on how the thing was built. It has a similar place in Sydney history to the Statue of-->

<!--            Outdoor pursuits here are epic. The area is one of Canada's pre-eminent destinations for hiking and mountain-->

<!--        <h2>Alaska Highway</h2>-->
<!--        <small>The Alaska Highway (also known as the Alaskan Highway, Alaska-Canadian Highway, or ALCAN Highway) was-->
<!--            constructed during World War II for the purpose of connecting the contiguous United States to Alaska across-->
<!--            Canada. It begins at the junction with several Canadian highways in Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and runs-->
<!--            to Delta Junction, Alaska, via Whitehorse, Yukon. Completed in 1942 at a length of approximately 1,700 miles-->
<!--            (2,700 km), as of 2012 it is 1,387 mi (2,232 km) long. The difference in distance is due to constant-->
<!--            reconstruction of the highway, which has rerouted and straightened out numerous sections. The highway was-->
<!--            opened to the public in 1948.[1] Legendary over many decades for being a rough, challenging drive, the-->
<!--            highway is now paved over its entire length.-->
<!---->
<!--            An informal system of historic mileposts developed over the years to denote major stopping points; Delta-->
<!--            Junction, at the end of the highway, makes reference to its location at "Historic Milepost 1422." It is at-->
<!--            this point that the Alaska Highway meets the Richardson Highway, which continues 96 mi (155 km) to the city-->
<!--            of Fairbanks. This is often regarded, though unofficially, as the northern portion of the Alaska Highway,-->
<!--            with Fairbanks at Historic Milepost 1520.[2] Mileposts on this stretch of highway are measured from Valdez,-->
<!--            rather than the Alaska Highway. The Alaska Highway is popularly (but unofficially) considered part of the-->
<!--            Pan-American Highway, which extends south (despite its discontinuity in Panama) to Argentina.-->
